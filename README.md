# MARC8

MARC (Minimal Architecture Rust CPU) is an 8-bit CPU project built in Rust. The goal is to explore basic computer architecture concepts by creating a minimalistic processor from scratch. MARC serves as an educational project to understand core CPU components such as registers, the ALU, instruction decoding, and memory access, all while utilizing Rust's safe and efficient programming model.
